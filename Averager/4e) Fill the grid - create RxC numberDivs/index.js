/*

We will now add lines to gridMaker() so that it also fills the grid with "numberDivs".

You must solve this in two different ways:
1) Use nested for-loops to do this. Use one for loop for the columns and one for the rows.
2) Use only one for-loop. How many times must it iterate?


VIDEO:  Record a video where you explain the two different ways (see above) of creating the right
        amount of numberDivs. The video should be called loopExplainer
